								<p>Except for a few teen years in Metchosin, I grew up on a tiny island with a population of about 150 people. The island was accessible only by a five-car ferry that stopped running at midnight. After that, no emergency vehicles (or anyone else) could get to us until morning. It was, and still is, prime agricultural land; we raised cattle briefly and then sheep. At one point we had as many sheep as there were people on the island. <b><i>I know island life and I know rural.</i></b></p>

								<p>I left the island for university, getting a Master’s degree in History from Carleton University, and a Master’s in Public Administration at Dalhousie University, graduating with the Merklinger Award for Public Policy.  For many years I worked for the federal government in Vancouver, in policy research, program management and planning. I got to apply these skills in program areas like early child development, mental health and addictions, and performing arts. I later managed a non-profit organization and became a management consultant to various non-profits in strategic planning, capital planning and budgeting. Some of my favourite projects were helping a local festival understand how to be much more effective with its resources, solving a management and budgeting issue that was about to make one non-profit lose all its clients, and conducting a needs assessment and creating an operating budget for a new $20million music hall.  <b><i>I know government and I have management skills.</i></b></p>

								<p>Arriving in Sooke, I volunteered as Vice-Chair of the Climate Action Committee. Using my knowledge of government processes and working in a community-based policy process, I developed the 7% Solution to reduce Sooke’s greenhouse gas emissions in line with international targets. The 7% Solution was approved unanimously by Council in June 2021.  <b><i>I know how to be effective in local government, and how to work with community.</i></b></p>

                                <hr />

								<p><b>I will use my skills and experience to serve Sooke.</b></p>
