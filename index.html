								<h4>For ten years my family and I criss-crossed BC looking for the right rural community to move to. When we had given up, we stumbled on Sooke.</h4>
								<p>In a truly stunning location there was this lovely small town with a heart of gold, and a wonderful climate. Nature, community, climate. We hadn’t found a place like it anywhere else in BC.</p>

								<h4>But since then Sooke has reached a turning point, where it seems we’re at risk of losing what makes our home special. </h4>
								<p>Development that sometimes doesn’t fit Sooke has clear-cut trees, removed farmland, blasted the rock, blocked the views. Many people I talk to are welcoming of newcomers, but express grief about what has been lost in the process.
									</p>
									<p>Our community has also grown much faster than our infrastructure, adding pressure to roads and medical services, and creating an urgent need for more sidewalks, bike lanes and transit. And despite the pace of growth, housing isn’t getting any more affordable.  Where Sooke used to be a haven of affordability, locals now struggle to find rental suites or to buy homes.</p>
									<p>Meanwhile, growth without limits will make it impossible to meet our climate targets, and Sooke - like all communities world-wide - is already experiencing troubling bouts of extreme weather.

								<h4>We need to take better care of this place, our community, and the climate. </h4>
								<p>We are not a community divided. Our community is fairly united in wanting to be welcoming to newcomers and keep what makes Sooke special. We know what to do to protect the land and water, to take care of our community and to address climate change in Sooke. We just need a Councillor willing to be a champion for this work. I have the skills and experience to serve you on Council and I’m asking for your support.
									</p>
									<p>We are not mistaken. Sooke is special. I know: I looked for ten years and never found another place like it.</p>

								<h2>Working in Council</h2>
								<p>A councillor is only one vote of seven. To be effective, a councillor needs to listen, learn fast, be well-prepared, be persuasive, and look for opportunities to build consensus. </br><b>As a councillor, I will look for opportunities to work with others on the following priorities:</b></p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane"> 
									<h3>Taking care of Nature #1</h3>
									<p>Keeping Sooke rural, in part by expanding our parks and protected areas. This may include looking for ways to secure larger, iconic parcels of land before they are lost to development, in order to create a jewel of a park in every neighbourhood. I will also look for opportunities to create public access to the waterfront.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Taking Care of Nature #2</h3>
									<p>Protecting our agricultural land base and supporting farms and food production on that land.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #1</h3>
									<p>Working with the CRD to address unrealistic growth expectations for Sooke given our infrastructure limits, so that we can build only the housing we need and don’t have to cut down more trees to build houses for investors to buy.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #2</h3>
									<p>Supporting truly affordable housing, including non-market housing and smaller market units, and considering a local development commission to ensure housing is built for locals and those in need. I’ll also work to ensure that the needs of renters are given sufficient attention by Council.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #3:</h3>
									<p>Because there is no easy, road-building solution to our traffic problems, addressing the transportation problem by providing options for school traffic, developing the local economy and supporting commuters to bring their jobs home, while also exploring new option for commuting. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #4:</h3>
									<p>Exploring ways to attract and retain sufficient medical services in Sooke, and supporting the components of a thriving, caring economy that benefits local business owners and offers good employment for residents.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our climate #1</h3>
									<p>Ensuring real action on the climate emergency, including implementing the 7% Solution to cut our current GHG pollution in half by 2030</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our climate #2</h3>
									<p>Developing a serious plan to address to the risks to our community from extreme weather events such as forest fires, heat domes, drought and atmospheric rivers.</p>
								</li>
