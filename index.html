								<p class="subject-line">For ten years my family and I criss-crossed BC looking for the right rural community to move to. When we had given up, we stumbled on Sooke.</p>
								<p>In a beautiful natural setting there was this down-to-earth small town with a heart of gold and a wonderful climate. We hadn't found a place like it anywhere else in BC.</p>

								<p class="subject-line">But Sooke has reached a turning point, where it seems we’re at risk of losing what makes our home special. </p>
								<p>Development that sometimes doesn’t fit Sooke has clear-cut trees, blasted the rock, blocked the views. Many people I talk to are welcoming of newcomers, but express grief about what has been lost in the process.
									</p>
									<p>Our community has also grown much faster than our medical services, sidewalks, bike lanes and transit. And despite the amount of new housing being built, locals still struggle to find affordable suites to rent or homes to buy.</p>
									<p>Meanwhile, growth without limits will make it impossible to meet our climate targets, even though we’re already experiencing periods of extreme weather linked to climate change.

								<p class="subject-line">We need to seek a new balance between the interests of developers and the needs of residents, think more strategically, and take better care of our community and this place. </p>
								<p>Sooke is special. I know: I looked for ten years and never found another place like it.  And our community is fairly united in wanting to keep what makes Sooke special. We have been told that it will have to get worse before it gets better, and that development is the only way to get the changes we need, from better transit to cheaper housing.  But there are other tools we can use; we just need a Councillor willing to be a champion for this work.

								<h2>Working in Council</h2>
								<p>A councillor has only one vote out of seven. To be effective, a councillor needs to be well-prepared, listen well, be persuasive, and look for opportunities to build consensus. </br><b>As a councillor, I will look for opportunities to think more strategically and collaborate with others in the following areas:</b></p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-tree"> 
									<h3>Parks</h3>
									<p>Keeping Sooke rural, in part by expanding our parks and protected areas. This may include looking for ways to buy important parcels of land before they are lost to development, in order to create a jewel of a park in every neighbourhood.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-tree">
									<h3>Agriculture and Food</h3>
									<p>Protecting our agricultural land base (including land in the town centre) and supporting farms and food production on that land. Creating a food hub for distribution and processing, and perhaps a pop-up incubator space for new restaurants and food trucks.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>Reasonable Growth</h3>
									<p>Challenging the CRD’s expectations for how much Sooke will grow, and insert language in the OCP that gives Sooke a choice in how much it will grow, based on an updated analysis of our housing needs.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>Affordable housing</h3>
									<p>Banking land for affordable housing projects and considering a local development commission so we can build affordable homes ourselves. I’ll also work to ensure that the needs of renters are given sufficient attention by Council.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>Traffic</h3>
									<p>Seek a partner to run a pilot project for a direct coach runing from Sooke to a commuting destination shared by a number of residents, and lobby BC Transit to implement its excellent transit plan for Sooke, starting with an express bus from Sooke to Victoria with a limited number of stops. Ensure bike paths and sidewalks are funded on par with new roads for vehicles. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>A local Economy</h3>
									<p>Consult with commuters to find out what supports they might need to “bring home” their jobs, along with the daily economic activity of half the working-age population.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-sun">
									<h3>Climate Action</h3>
									<p>Ensure real action on the climate emergency, including implementing the 7% Solution to cut our current GHG pollution in half by 2030 and putting a heat pump in every home, starting with every single new unit constructed.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-sun">
									<h3>Climate Protection</h3>
									<p>Developing a serious plan to address the risks to our community from extreme weather events such as forest fires, heat domes, drought and flooding.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>Developing relations</h3>
									<p>Seeking a new balance between the interests of developers and the needs of residents by securing part of the increased value when land is rezoned for major developments, as a financial contribution to the District. The fund could be used to create new parks and truly affordable housing. Increase overshight on large development projects. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-house-user">
									<h3>Waterfront Access</h3>
									<p>Working with community members and property owners to build a consensus on what should happen with Sooke’s waterfront and ensure more public access to the waterfront, while planning for sea level rise.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-sun">
									<h3>A Caring Economy</h3>
									<p>Explore ways to bring better medical services to Sooke, and expand a caring economy based on health services, education, social services and green businesses with local leadership and good employment for residents.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-sun">
									<h3>A Green Economy</h3>
									<p>Provide supports to local builders and construction workers so that builders are able to take on projects for green homes and multi-unit residential buildings, and construction workers can also take on important roles in the growing field of energy audits and retrofitting.</p>
