								<h4>For ten years my family and I criss crossed BC looking for the right rural community to move to.<br />
									When we had given up, we stumbled on Sooke.</h4>
								<p>In a truly stunning location there was this lovely small town with a heart of gold, and a wonderful climate. Nature, community, climate. We hadn’t found a place like it anywhere else in BC.</p>

								<h2>But Sooke is at a turning point,<br />
									where it seems we’re at risk of losing what makes our home special.</h2>
								<p>Development unsympathetic to Sooke has clear-cut trees in some places, removed farmland, blasted the rock, blocked the views. Many people I talk to are welcoming of newcomers, but struggle with what has been lost in the process.
									</p>
									<p>Our community has also grown faster than our infrastructure, adding pressure to traffic, medical facilities, and sewer systems. And despite the pace of growth, housing isn’t getting any more affordable.  High-end developments and the influence of investors from larger communities have given us housing so expensive that locals are struggling to find rental suite or to buy homes. None of that is why we love Sooke.</p>
									<p>Meanwhile, growth without limits will make it impossible to meet our climate targets, and Sooke , like all communities world-wide, is already experiencing the risk of extreme weather.

									</p>
									<p>Because Sooke is special. I know, I looked for ten years and never found another place like it.</p>

								<h2>Heading tba</h2>
								<p>A councillor is only one vote in seven. To be effective, councillors need to listen well, learn fast, be well-prepared, be persuasive, and look for opportunities to build consensus and work with others. As a councillor, </br><b>I will look for opportunities to work on the following priorities:</b></p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane"> 
									<h3>Taking care of Nature #1</h3>
									<p>Protecting Sooke’s rural character by expanding our parks and protected areas. This may include securing larger, undeveloped parcels of land before they are lost to development in order to create a jewel of a park in every neighbourhood, and nature corridors linking our wild spaces and intertwined with our residential areas. I will also look for opportunities to create public access to the waterfront.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Taking Care of Nature #2</h3>
									<p>Protecting agricultural land and supporting food production on that land.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #1</h3>
									<p>Finding ways to reduce traffic by: supporting local economic development that benefits local business owners and offers good employment for residents; making it easier for commuters to bring their jobs home; exploring alternative commuting modes, and supporting active travel corridors. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #2</h3>
									<p>Supporting truly affordable housing, including non-market housing and smaller market units, as well as making sure that the needs of renters are given sufficient attention by Council.

									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #3:</h3>
									<p>Working with the CRD to address unrealistic growth expectations for Sooke given our infrastructure limits.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our community #4:</h3>
									<p>Exploring ways to attract and retain sufficient medical services in Sooke.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our climate #1</h3>
									<p>Ensuring real action on the climate emergency, including implementing the 7% Solution to cut our current GHG pollution in half by 2030</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Taking care of our climate #2</h3>
									<p>Developing a serious plan to address the risks to our community from extreme weather events such as flood, fire, drought, heat, and extreme wind or rainfall.</p>
								</li>
